= Overview

This is a very simple Spring Boot project that says hello world, with Jenkins spice added to it.  It uses
the default OpenShift Jenkins `maven` slave node for running Jenkins jobs

[NOTE]
===
* First builds will usually take time as jenkins image needs to pulled
===

[source,sh]
---
git clone https://github.com/kameshsampath/helloboot
./mvnw clean fabric8:deploy
---

Once fabric8:deploy is successful you will see a Jenkins Pipeline in the OpenShift

== OpenShift Role and Role Bindings

Since the default service account of the the project does not have enough privileges to do some OpenShift operations,
we need to add the role and binding. For this purpose we will create a Role Binding called `edit_jenkins_slave`
and attach same ot service Account called `helloboot`.  To get that configured excute the following commands
form the examples directory of the project

[source,sh]
----
cd $PROJECT_HOME/examples

oc apply -f openshift
